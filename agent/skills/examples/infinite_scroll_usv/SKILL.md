description: Reference retrieve_jobs implementation for extracting all jobs from an infintie scroll jobs dashboard (Based on the USV dashboard on 12/29/2025)

# Explanation
There is a working retrieve_jobs implementation you can use as a starting point in examples/infinite_scroll_usv/retrieve_jobs.py

This example shows how to extract jobs from a job dashboard with infinite scroll paging. 

It was verified to complete your full task properly for the Union Square Venture's job dashboard: https://jobs.usv.com/jobs on 12/29/2025. 

You cannot (and should not) run this script directly, but you can copy it into the workspace folder and then run / iterate on it.
